# Axle-search
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/)

A rust library supported for web (WASM) too, this is a venture to build a lightweight search tool (like elastic search, algolia) with a catch that it supports multiple flavors of algorithms for phonetic search, fuzzy search...etc that can be used as a plugin to change the way of how you want to "search".
